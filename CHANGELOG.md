- Add rule name to default reporter. [#11](https://github.com/coffeelint/coffeelint/pull/11)

## [1.15.0](https://github.com/coffeelint/coffeelint/compare/v1.14.1...v1.15.0) (2015-11-18)

This version updates the enable/disable directives. In addition to
the existing `# coffeelint: disable=rule_name` you can also
use `# coffeelint: disable-line=rule_name`. The rule name is
still optional in both cases, and you can enable the rules using
the same syntax.

You can also use `# noqa` as a shortcut for `# coffeelint: disable-line`

- See [#552](https://github.com/clutchski/coffeelint/pull/552) for more details.

## [1.14.1](https://github.com/coffeelint/coffeelint/compare/v1.14.0...v1.14.1) (2015-11-18)

Most of the changes are more for linting the development files of
coffeelint. The minor version increase is due to the change in
cyclomatic_complexity, which now ignores nested functions. I foresee
this change affecting very few people but probably still needs a minor
version increase.

- `cyclomatic_complexity` rule has been changed to ignore nested functions
- 1.4.1: inlined rules not previously specified in JSON config now properly return a message

## [1.13.0](https://github.com/coffeelint/coffeelint/compare/v1.11.0...v1.13.0) (2015-10-07)

The v1.12.x versions are considered buggy and you should upgrade to v1.13.x if you experience problems

**These releases were largely for bugfixes!**

- Bugfix for `no_implicit_braces` causing errors in classes and other edge cases
- Bugfix for `ensure_comprehensions` where it failed if a nested loop had an equal sign
- Bugfix for `braces_spacing` failing over generated curly braces
- Several changes to `indentation` See [bffa25](https://github.com/coffeelint/coffeelint/commit/bffa2532efd8bcca5d9c1b3a9d3b5914e882dd5f) for the full list of changes. However between the release of v1.12.0 and v1.13.0, a regression was caused by fixing one of the indentation requests and as a result the change was reverted. The revert will most likely not affect too many users
- Bugfix for `newlines_after_classes`, also fixed regressions caused between v1.12.0 and v1.13.0. If you have v1.12.x and are experiencing problems, please upgrade. Also note nested classes are now ignored completely
- `no_this` is now compatible with `no_stand_alone_at` and will make checks against singular `this`
- Bugfix for `missing_fat_arrows`, declaring a class prototype (via '::' operator) no longer fail if they don't use a fat arrow
- Bugfix for `eol_last`, it now fails if there are multiple newlines at the end of a file (thanks [charlierudolph](https://github.com/charlierudolph))-
- Bugfix for `arrow_spacing`, now ignores arrow spacing in empty functions (thanks [sgentle](https://github.com/sgentle))
